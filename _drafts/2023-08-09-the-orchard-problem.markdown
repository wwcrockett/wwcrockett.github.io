### Introduction 
While driving along I-5 in central California, you drive past countless orchards. At first you try to guess what kind of trees they are:

>Those look like walnuts!

>I'm pretty sure those are apricots...

>No! They look like almond trees!

But once you accept that your ability to identify fruit trees based on a passing glance at 85 MPH is lacking, you begin to look at the orchard as a whole. The orchard is a blend of Euclidean and Fractal geometries. It is the meeting point of two methods of optimization: humanity's need for uniform rows and columns and evolution's solution for space filling distribution networks.

### Branching


### Euclid's Orchard 

When you stop missing the Orchard for the trees, what jumps out is how complex the regular grid appears from your perspective. You can see the rows, but you also see other lines of trees jumping out. If the trees are abstracted away, you end up with a uniform array of unit length vertical line segments. This abstraction, referred to as Euclid's Orchard, has some deep connections to other corners of math, particularly the notion of prime and coprime numbers. This problem has many connections in pure math, applied math, and physics [[NechaevPolovnikov2018]]. 


Euclid's Geometry is a world of points, lines and planes. It is the world of uniformity, continuous differentiable functions, regular polygons, and circles. This geometry easily explains and illuminates the depths of the orchard. It implicitly assumes the orchard's ideal structure, which based on the goal of filling a 2-D surface with points, is to distribute each tree with a uniform distance from its neighbors. The math that accompanies this view provides beautiful insights into the distribution of integers.

So if the uniform grid is the ideal way of filling a 2-D surface, where is it in nature? Surely, given the complex forms of life around us, if a grid was optimal evolution would have converged on it long ago. Well it turns out that the complex forms we see across life, and indeed across nature both living and non-living, are finding optima of problems with a single key difference.


Euclid, and mathematicians for centuries, seem to have missed the trees for the orchard. Ideas that appeared in the 20th century and were unified under Benoit Mandelbrot's Fractal Geometries showed that the beautiful, regular world of Euclid was but a special subset of the possible functions. Fractal geometry allowed mathematicians and scientists to reproduce and explain the true shapes we see in nature, and it did so through a fundamental questioning of *dimension*. 

The *dimension* of a problem is a quantification of the number of dimensions or degrees of freedom. For example, Euclid's description of the orchard can be seen as a 2-dimensional plane of points, or a 3-dimensional space with uniform line segments positioned on a 2-dimensional grid. In Mandelbrot's *The Fractal Geometry of Nature*, he reevaluates the notion of *dimension*, and introduces an alternative to the traditional view. 

The term *fractal dimension* helps describe his many fractals, both in form and in underlying function. Brownian motion is taken as the first true foray into fractal sets by mathematicians. Not only is the path of Brownian motion a discontinuous function at every length scale, it introduces a flaw in the concept of dimension. If one traces the path of a particle subjected to Brownian motion, that path is topologically a one dimensional line. But if one continuous to track the particle's path in a confined 2-D space, there would come a time where that path completely fills the space. Taking a step back, is the dimension of the path 1-D or 2-D? This is the essence of the *fractal-dimension*, a powerful idea that allows one to describe the form of an object that fills space in a higher dimension.

It turns out that this problem existed in the Orchard all along. Euclid's description of an orchard as a uniform grid of line segments provides a useful tool to see the beautiful arrangement of common multipliers and co-primes in integers, but this geometric approach misses the trees for the orchard. It turns out that the complex branching patterns of the trees and the complex shape of the leaves that Euclid felt was best to ignore and approximate as a line segment of unit length evolved to solve the same fundamental puzzle as the farmers who chose to plant their trees in a grid: "How do we optimally fill a constrained space?" While the farmer's goal is to uniformly distribute trees (which they might view as circles, squares, hexagons, or whatever Euclidean geometrical abstraction best approximates the surface area needed for each tree) in 2-d space, the tree's goal is to optimize the amount of photosynthesizing surface area in a 3 dimensional space. Here is where the central idea of Mandelbrot's fractals emerge: while Euclid questioned a 2 dimensional problem in 2 dimensional space, his approaches were at a loss to explain the seemingly impossibly complex forms that nature used to optimize a 2-dimensional measurement in 3-dimensional space.

Like the path of the Brownian particle, here we have a dissonance in dimensionality, calling for fractal geometry.

It turns out that while each tree and plant is unique in its approach to this problem, and that there are many approaches to modeling these approaches **CITE**, taking a fractal approach can help us see the fundamental geometries of these shapes.



So if you find yourself on I-5 or some other highway surrounded by the [[living-crystals|living crystal]] produced by the symbioses between humans and plants, see if you can spend some time looking at each side's approach. Can you see how the tree's seemingly complex branching twists and turns allow it to optimize its surface area exposed to the sun? Can you let your focus broaden to see the harmonic rows produced by your line of sight meeting a uniform grid? Can you let your thoughts broaden to include both?
